# Robot Walking Algorithm using Servo Motors

## Objective:

To control servo motors and create a walking motion for a robot.

Hardware Requirements:

Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino)
Servo Motors 
Motor Driver 
Sensors ( e.g., gyroscope, accelerometer)
Software Algorithm:

## 1. Initialization:

Define servo pin connections for each leg joint.
Set initial servo positions for standing posture.
 Calibrate sensors.


## 2. Main Loop:

Read sensor data .
Based on the desired gait (e.g., tripod gait, quadruped gait), calculate target positions for each leg joint for the next walking step.
Send control signals to the servo motors to move towards the target positions.
Implement timing delays or use feedback from sensors to control movement speed and ensure proper leg placement.
Update the current leg positions based on the movement.


## 3. Gait Control:

Define functions for each step of the gait cycle (e.g., lift, swing, place).
Each function calculates target positions for all leg joints based on the specific gait stage.


## 4. Walking Pattern:

Implement a loop or state machine to control the sequence of gaits (e.g., forward walk, turn).
Each gait can be triggered by user input, sensor feedback, or pre-defined walking patterns.
